          Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment
           for goods and services and repayment of debts, such as taxes,
            in a particular country or socio-economic context.
            The primary functions which distinguish money are: medium of exchange,
            a unit of account, a store of value and sometimes, a standard of deferred payment.
